- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mossborb
- 👀 I’m interested in eventually making this readme more interesting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, mySQL, and all other tools to become a data scienctist like everyone and their mother.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I'm open to learning every day. Anything to get me away from working my 5-20 job. 
- 📫 How to reach me : Mossborb@gmail.com is a good start.
